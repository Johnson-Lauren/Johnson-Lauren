ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Johnson-Lauren!
Iâ€™m interested in marketing and sports analytics! Iâ€™m currently earning my Masters of Science in Business Analytics from Wake Forest University School of Business.
Iâ€™m looking to add school projects to my repository, but also develop new projects through the GitHub space. I would love to connect with the community and learn as much as I can from my fellow analyst!
ðŸ“« I can be reached at johnson.lauren.e1@gmail.com.
